# Mainland-Consultants

Here is the new mainlandconsultants.co.uk/ source code
It is fully responsive for both mobiles and tablets.

Technologies used for the site:
HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, Gulp, Photoshop

The site is fully functional on Google Chrome, FireFox, Microsoft Edge and IE 11.  
Not tested on Safari. 

// Fixing issues with JSON and jQuery
jQuery 1.12.4 was used on the site rather than 3.3.1 because when Internet Explorer runs in compatibility view, it emulates IE8 which is incompatible with the latest version of jQuery (only the 1.x versions of jQuery are compatible with older versions of IE).
